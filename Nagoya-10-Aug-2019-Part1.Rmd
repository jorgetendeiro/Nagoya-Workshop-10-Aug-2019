# Fraud {.section}

## Definition
Fraud = scientifc misconduct.

- Falsifying or fabricating data.
- This is intentional, not accidental. 
- Puts all science under a <span style="color:red">bad light</span>.
- Markedly different from QRPs (next).

## Notable examples
- Diederik Stapel, social psychologist. Suspended in 2011. [Fabricating and manipulating data](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/magazine/diederik-stapels-audacious-academic-fraud.html?pagewanted=1&_r=0&src=recg).
- Marc Hauser, psychologist at Harvard. Resigned in 2011. [Scientific misconduct](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/05/29/internal-harvard-report-shines-light-misconduct-star-psychology-researcher-marc-hauser/maSUowPqL4clXrOgj44aKP/story.html).
- Jens Förster, social psychologist. Resigned in 2017. [Data tampering](https://retractionwatch.com/2017/12/12/psychologist-fire-leaves-university-start-private-practice/).
<br><br><br>

Today we don't talk about fraud *explicitly*.

We talk about something much harder to identify and erradicate:

<p align="center"><span style="color:red">Questionable research practices</span>.</p>

# Questionable research practices {.section}

## QRPs
Coin termed by @john2012.<br>
See also @simmons2011.
<br><br>

- <span style="color:red">Not necessarily</span> fraud.
- Includes the (ab)use of actually *acceptable* research practices.
- Problem with QRPs:<br>
    * Introduce <span style="color:red">bias</span> (typically, in *favor* of the researcher's intentions...).
    * <span style="color:red">Inflated power</span> at the cost of inflated Type I error probability ($\gg 5\%$).
    * Results <span style="color:red">not replicable</span>.

## Example of QRPs
[@john2012; @schimmack2015].

- Omit some DVs.
- Omit some conditions.
- <span style="color:red">Peeking</span>: Sequential testing --- Look and decide:
    * $p > .05$: Collect more.
    * $p < .05$: Stop.
- Only report $p<.05$ results.
- <span style="color:red">$p$-hacking</span>: E.g., 
    - Exclusion of outliers depending on whether $p<.05$.
    - $p = .054 \longrightarrow p = .05$.
- <span style="color:red">HARKing</span> [@kerr1998]: Convert exploratory results into research questions.
- ...

## Researcher's degrees of freedom
- Researchers have a <span style="color:red">multitude</span> of decisions to make (experiment design, data collection, analyses performed); @wicherts2016, @steegen2016.
- It is very possible to manipulate results *in favor* of one's interests.
- This is now known as *researcher's degrees of freedom* [@simmons2011].
- Consequence: Inflated false positive findings [@ioannidis2005].

- The 7 most common depression scales contain 52 symptoms.

</div>

## A now famous example...
Prof. Brian Wansink at Cornell University.

[His description](https://web.archive.org/web/20170312041524/http:/www.brianwansink.com/phd-advice/the-grad-student-who-never-said-no) of the efforts of a visiting Ph.D student:

> I gave her a <span style="color:red">data set</span> of a self-funded, failed study which had <span style="color:red">null results</span> (...). I said, "This cost us a lot of time and our own money to collect. There’s got to be something here we can salvage because it’s a cool (rich & unique) data set." I had three ideas for potential Plan B, C, & D directions (since Plan A had failed). I told her what the analyses should be and what the tables should look like. I then asked her if she wanted to do them.

> Every day she came back with puzzling new results, and every day we would scratch our heads, ask "Why," and <span style="color:red">come up with another way to reanalyze the data</span> with yet another set of plausible hypotheses. Eventually <span style="color:red">we started discovering solutions</span> that held up regardless of how we pressure-tested them. I outlined the first paper, and she wrote it up (...). This happened with a second paper, and then a third paper (which was one that was based on her own discovery while digging through the data).

This isn't being *creative* or *thinking outside the box*.

<span style="color:red">This is QRPing.</span>

## What happened to Wansink?
- He was severely criticized, his work was scrutinized [e.g., @vanderzee2017].
- Over 100 (!!) errors in a set of four papers...
- Has now <span style="color:red">40</span> (!!) publications [retracted](http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dWansink%252c%2bBrian) (as of July 2019).
- After a year-long internal investigation, he was forced to [resign](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2018/09/provost-issues-statement-wansink-academic-misconduct-investigation).

## Is it really *that* bad?...
[Yes](https://www.westernalliance.org.au/2018/05/restoring-trust-in-science-what-are-questionable-research-practices).

- @martinson2005: "Scientists behaving badly".
- @fanelli2009: Meta-analysis shows evidence of science misconduct.
- @john2012: Evidence for QRPs in psychology.
- @mobley2013: Reported evidence of pressure to *find* significant results.
- @agnoli2017: Evidence of QRPs, now in Italy.
- @fraser2018: In other fields of science.
<br><br>

Interestingly, science misconduct has been a longtime concern [see @babbage1830].
<br><br>

And for the sake of balance:<br>
There are also some voices *against* this description of the current state of affairs [e.g., @fiedler2016].

# But *why*?... {.section}

## Why are QRPs so prevalent?
It is strongly related to incentives [@nosek2012; @schonbrodt2015].

- "Publish or perish":<br>
Publish a lot, at highly prestigious journals.
    - Journals only publish a fraction of all manuscripts.
    - Journals don't like publishing null findings...
- Get tenured.
- Get research grant.
- Fame (prizes, press coverage, ...).
- ...
<br><br><br>

But, <span style="color:red">very importantly</span>, it also happens in spite of the <span style="color:green">researcher's best intentions</span>.

- Deficient statistics education (yes, statisticians need to acknowledge this!...).
- Perpetuating traditions in the field.

## Lack of replications
Until very recently [@makel2012].
<br>

```{r, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/Makel 2012.png')

- Very low rate of replications in Psychology (estimated ~1%).
- Until 2012, majority of replications were actually <span style="color:red">successful</span>!!
- However, in most cases both the original and replication studies shared authorship...
- Conflict of interest?...

- The whole blog post is worth reading for many reasons, including Gelman's criticism over criticism!<br>
(versus Susan Fiske's [position](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/a-call-to-change-sciences-culture-of-shaming)).

# $p$-values {.section}

## Definition
> Probability of an effect at least as extreme as the one we observed, *given that $\mathcal{H}_0$ is true*.


\[\fbox{$ p\text{-value} = P\left(X_\text{obs} \text{ or more extreme}|\mathcal{H}_0\right) $}\]

The definition is simple enough, right?...

## Test yourself
Consider the following statement [@oakes1986; @falk1995; @haller2002; @gigerenzer2004]:

> *Suppose you have a treatment that you suspect may alter performance on a certain task. You compare the
means of your control and experimental groups (say, 20 subjects in each sample). Furthermore, suppose you
use a simple <span style="color:red">independent means $t$-test</span> and your result is <span style="color:red">significant</span> ($t = 2.7$, $df = 18$, $p = .01$). Please mark
each of the statements below as "true" or "false."* False *means that the statement does not follow logically
from the above premises. Also note that several or none of the statements may be correct.*

## Test yourself

# Confidence intervals {.section}

## A better alternative?
- Confidence intervals (CIs) have been often advocated as the best inferential alternative to NHST.
- Recall, for example the Wilkinson Task Force [@wilkinson1999]:

> "(...) it is hard to imagine a situation in which a dichotomous accept–reject decision is better than reporting an actual $p$ value or, better still, a <span style="color:red">confidence interval</span>.”

- But, are CIs really a better alternative? 

## Definition
See, for instance, @hoekstra2014.

> A (say) 95% CI is a numerical interval found through a procedure that, if repeated across a series of hypothetical data, leads to an interval covering the true parameter 95% of the times.

- A CI indicates a property of the performance of the <span style="color:red">procedure</span> used to compute it:<br>
How is the <span style="color:red">procedure</span> expected to perform in the long run?
- A CI for a parameter is constructed <span style="color:red"> around the parameter's estimate</span>.
- However, a CI does not (really <span style="color:red">not</span>!) directly indicate a property of the parameter being estimated!
<br><br>

Confused?<br>
So is the vast majority of social scientists...

## Test yourself
From @hoekstra2014, mimicking the $p$ value study by @gigerenzer2004.

## Results
But how did students and teachers perceive these statements?

```{r, out.width='45%'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/Hoekstra2014 III.png')
```

## What would be correct, then?...
> “If we were to repeat the experiment over and over, then 95% of the time the confidence intervals contain the true mean.”

How informative is this?!
<br><br><br>

Mental note:<br>

# What do statistical associations advice? {.section}

## Wilkinson Task Force 1999
Among many many, advices, 

- Do not focus on $p$ values.
- Report effect sizes.
- Report power analyses.
- Check model assumptions.

> "Novice researchers err either by overgeneralizing their results or, equally unfortunately, by overparticularizing."

## ASA 2016 [@wasserstein2016]
```{r, out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/Wasserstein2016.png')
```

Six principles:

1. $p$-values can indicate how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model.
2. $p$-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone.
3. Scientific conclusions and business or policy decisions should not be based only on whether a $p$-value passes a specific threshold.
4. Proper inference requires full reporting and transparency.
5. A $p$-value, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result.
6. By itself, a $p$-value does not provide a good measure of evidence regarding a model or hypothesis.

## ASA 2019 [@wasserstein2019]
```{r, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/Wasserstein2019.png')
```

This is an editorial of a special issue consisting of 43 (!!) papers.

Main ideas:

- "Don't" is not enough -- Some *what to do* advices are provided.
- However... Don’t say “statistically significant” -- Just <span style="color:red">**don't**</span>.

> "(...) it is time to <span style="color:red">stop</span> using the term “statistically significant” entirely. Nor should variants such as “significantly different,” “$p < 0.05$,” and “nonsignificant” survive, whether expressed in words, by asterisks in a table, or in some other way."

But:

> "Despite the limitations of $p$-values (...), however, we are not recommending that the calculation and use of continuous
$p$-values be discontinued. Where $p$-values are used, they should be reported as continuous quantities (e.g., $p = 0.08$).
They should also be described in language stating what the value means in the scientific context."

- There is no unique "do":

> "What you will NOT find in this issue is one solution that majestically replaces the outsized role that statistical significance has come to play."

- <span style="color:red">Accept uncertainty</span> (I cannot stress this enough!). <br>
Be thoughtful, open, and modest.

- Editorial, educational, and other institutional practices will have to change.
<br>
This includes: Journals, funding agencies, education, career system.

- Value replicability, open materials and data, and reliable practices (which all take time) over "publish or perish".

> "(...) Replicability is not the only criterion of a first-rate science journal, but it had better be a <span style="color:red">fundamental</span> one."

> "My emphasis here is on experiments and NHST, (...) (By the way, I am enthusiastically open to submissions that make appropriate use of <span style="color:red">alternatives to NHST</span> [read: Bayes].)"

## In Nature [@camerer2018]
> "The replications follow <span style="color:red">analysis plans reviewed by the original authors</span> and <span style="color:red">pre-registered</span> prior to the replications."

> The replications are high powered, with <span style="color:red">sample sizes on average about five times higher</span> than in the original studies."

> "We find a <span style="color:red">significant effect in the same direction</span> as the original study for 13 (<span style="color:red">62%</span>) studies, and the <span style="color:red">effect size</span> of the replications is on average <span style="color:red">about 50%</span> of the original effect size."

Conclusion:<br>
Results published in high rank journals should be considered with care until they are <span style="color:red">replicated</span>.

## The PRO initiative [@morey2016a]
- PRO = <span style="color:red">P</span>eer <span style="color:red">R</span>eviewers' <span style="color:red">O</span>penness.
- Thus, guidelines for paper <span style="color:red">reviewers</span>.
- See [https://opennessinitiative.org](https://opennessinitiative.org).
<br><br><br>

Main [goals](https://opennessinitiative.org/the-initiative/):

1. Data should be made publicly available.
2. Stimuli and materials should be made publicly available.
3. In case some data or materials are not open, clear reasons (e.g., legal, ethical constraints, or severe impracticality) should be given why.
4. Documents containing details for interpreting any files or code, and how to compile and run any software programs should be made available with the above items. 
5. The location of all of these files should be advertised in the manuscript, and all files should be hosted by a reliable third party.

## Bullying

- Debates in blogs, Twitter, and journals can be fierce.
- Criticism <span style="color:red">should be part</span> of science, of course.
- It's not bullying to criticize, of course, in particular, with grounded reasons (vide Wansink).
- But sometimes criticism gets <span style="color:red">too carried away</span>, IMHO.

## Self-appointed police
Most likely, each of us has some skeleton's in their scientific closets.

We've all fallen prey to one or more of the problems mentioned today.

Full disclosure:

So:

Or in the words of Brian Nosek (as quoted [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/psychologys-replication-crisis-has-made-the-field-better/)):

> "We’re not here to *be right*. We’re here to *get it right*."
