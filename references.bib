  abstract = {Because scientists tend to report only studies (publication bias) or analyses (p-hacking) that ``work,'' readers must ask, ``Are these effects true, or do they merely reflect selective reporting?'' We introduce p-curve as a way to answer this question. P-curve is the distribution of statistically significant p values for a set of studies (ps p-curves\textemdash{}containing more low (.01s) than high (.04s) significant p values\textemdash{}only right-skewed p-curves are diagnostic of evidential value. By telling us whether we can rule out selective reporting as the sole explanation for a set of findings, p-curve offers a solution to the age-old inferential problems caused by file-drawers of failed studies and analyses.

  abstract = {Journals tend to publish only statistically significant evidence, creating a scientific record that markedly overstates the size of effects. We provide a new tool that corrects for this bias without requiring access to nonsignificant results. It capitalizes on the fact that the distribution of significant p values, p-curve, is a function of the true underlying effect. Researchers armed only with sample sizes and test results of the published findings can correct for publication bias. We validate the technique with simulations and by reanalyzing data from the Many-Labs Replication project. We demonstrate that p-curve can arrive at conclusions opposite that of existing tools by reanalyzing the meta-analysis of the "choice overload" literature.},
