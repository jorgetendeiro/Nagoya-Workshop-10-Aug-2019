## Introduction to Bayes
<span style="color:green">Papers:</span>

- @etz2018: The "Harry Potter" paper.<br>
*Very* accessible introduction, with examples.
- @etz2018a: "How to become a Bayesian in eight easy steps: An annotated reading list".<br>
Yes, Alexander Etz writes 'readible' papers *very* well. Strongly advised read, but it takes quite some time to process.
- @kruschke2013: Besides providing an excellent introduction to core concepts, Kruschke offers a discussion over the "testing" versus "estimation" tension. I personally like Kruschke's position on this matter.

<span style="color:green">Books:</span>

- @kruschke2015: The "puppies" book.<br>
Accessible book, with plenty of examples and code. Perfect as a first pick.
- @mcelreath2016: From what I read thus far, this book is a jewel.
- @lambert2018: I'm currently half way. Seems perfect for teaching (hence learning!).
- @gelman2014: More advanced read (perhaps not the first pick), but truly a master piece.

## Learn about JASP

<span style="color:green">Website</span><br> [https://jasp-stats.org/how-to-use-jasp/](https://jasp-stats.org/how-to-use-jasp/).<br>
It includes:

- [Tutorial section](https://jasp-stats.org/how-to-use-jasp/)
- [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSulowI4mXFyBkw3bmp7pXg) to see (and hear) it in action.
- [Forum](http://forum.cogsci.nl/index.php?p=/categories/jasp-bayesfactor) to post lingering questions.
- [Teaching with JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/teaching-with-jasp/) includes much more material.

<br>
<span style="color:green">Video tutorials</span><br>
Etz (who else?) is making videos as we speak.<br>
